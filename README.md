MATLAB and C++ implementations to image behind corners.

To test this code, feel free to use example videos of the shadows (penumbras) of people
moving behind a corner, available at this link:
http://people.csail.mit.edu/klbouman/pw/projects/cornercam/code.html

The MATLAB code can be run on existing video files.
The C++ code requires OpenCV 3, and can be run on existing videos, live webcam
input, and live PointGrey Camera input.
